**ISRO Launches Dashboard (Using the ISRO API)**

This project lets you search for ISRO Launches and displays information about them.

**Installation**

1. Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/iamvisshu/ISRO_Launches_API.git`.
2. Open the project directory in your code editor.
3. You'll don't need to obtain any ISRO API access token as it's public api. Follow the instructions on https://services.isrostats.in/api/launches/.

**Usage**

1. Make sure you have your ISRO access token stored securely (if needed, in my case it was not).
2. Open `index.html` (or the main HTML file) in your web browser.
3. Enter a launch name or vehicle in the search bar and press Enter.
4. The project should fetch information about the searched launch(s) from the ISRO API and display it on the page.

**API**

This project uses the ISRO Web API https://services.isrostats.in/api/launches/.
Please refer this documentation https://isrostats.in/apis to know more about it.
